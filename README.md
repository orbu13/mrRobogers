My School Project
This project is a part of my school coursework and aims to showcase my skills in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Project Description
The main objective of this project is to create a web application that generates a modified string of numbers based on specific conditions. The application uses JavaScript to manipulate the numbers and apply the corresponding replacements. It incorporates HTML for the structure and CSS for styling.

Features
The application takes user input and generates a modified string of numbers.
It replaces certain numbers based on specific conditions, such as replacing numbers containing '1' with "BEEP!", '2' with "BOOP!", and '3' with "Won't you be my neighbor?!".
The generated string is displayed to the user.
Technologies Used
HTML: Used for creating the structure of the web page.
CSS: Used for styling the web page and making it visually appealing.
JavaScript: Used for implementing the logic of the number modifications and generating the final string.
